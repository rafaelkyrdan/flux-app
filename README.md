# flux-app
Project for self-education. In progress.

## This app is built based on:

* react
* flux
* react-router
* babel
* webpack

## How to run it locally?

* Install the local dependencies, run the command `npm install` in the root directory of the project:

`npm install`

* Now run `webpack` in the root folder of the project. This builds the project in the `dist` folder and watches for any changes.
Also it will run `webpack-dev-server`.

`npm start`
